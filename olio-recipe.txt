Cook pasta as normal. The pasta can be any type (spaghetti, penne, angel hair, etc).
Place in a pan olive oil, pressed raw garlic, and crushed red pepper. Cook the
pressed garlic at a low temperature just enough so it is no longer raw.
Then place the pasta in the pan and mix the contents for a couple minutes while still
on low temperature. Remove from the pan and enjoy!
